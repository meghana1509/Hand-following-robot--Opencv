# Vision-Based Hand Following Robot

This project implements a real-time hand-following vision system using OpenCV and MediaPipe on Ubuntu Linux.

## Features
- Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe
- Hand centroid and bounding box extraction
- Direction control: LEFT / RIGHT / CENTER
- Distance-based motion logic: FORWARD / HOLD / STOP
- Designed as a perception module for a differential drive robot

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Ubuntu Linux

## How it Works
Camera → Hand Detection → Error Calculation → Motion Commands

## Future Work
- Serial communication with robot
- ROS integration
- PID-based motion control
